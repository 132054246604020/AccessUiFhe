### Components

#### 1. User Module
- Encrypts accessibility preferences locally  
- Supports multi-modal inputs (visual, auditory, motor, cognitive)  

#### 2. FHE Personalization Engine
- Processes encrypted inputs to compute personalized UI parameters  
- Supports aggregation and analytics on encrypted datasets  
- Ensures privacy-preserving computation  

#### 3. UI Renderer
- Applies computed adjustments to interface components  
- Updates UI dynamically without exposing underlying data  
- Provides responsive and adaptive accessibility features

## Why FHE Matters

- **Privacy First:** User accessibility preferences never leave device in plain form  
- **Secure Personalization:** Compute dynamic UI adjustments without decrypting sensitive data  
- **Trust & Adoption:** Users can confidently share accessibility preferences knowing they remain private  
- **Scalable:** Supports personalization for large user bases without centralizing sensitive information

## Use Cases

1. **Visually Impaired Users**
   - High contrast, larger fonts, screen reader optimized layouts  

2. **Hearing Impaired Users**
   - Encrypted audio preferences trigger captions, vibrations, or visual cues  

3. **Motor Accessibility**
   - Adjusts touch targets, interaction timing, and input methods based on encrypted input  

4. **Cognitive Assistance**
   - Simplified UI layouts, color-coded cues, or guided workflows based on encrypted preferences

## Security Features

- **Client-Side Encryption:** User preferences encrypted before leaving the device  
- **Encrypted Computation:** UI adjustments computed without revealing data  
- **Anonymity by Design:** No personally identifiable information is stored  
- **Immutable Privacy Guarantees:** Preferences cannot be exposed even to administrators
